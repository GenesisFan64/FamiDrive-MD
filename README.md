# FamiDrive-MD
A modification of Nemul, originally made by Mairtrus, so credits to him for his effort...
** ROMS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE SOURCE ***

Now it boots on real hardware, also added support for another mapper: CNROM

Current issues:
- Obviously slow. probably will stay like this
- Changed how it draws the screen background, but palette selection isn't done yet
- Some games doesn't work
